# Finance Calculator 

A python Implementation for a finance calculator 

This is a part of a series of HyperionDev Capstone Projects, I will be creating a finance calculator using the python language.
In this Capstone Project, I will be creating a program that allows the user to calculate their interest on an investment or calculate the amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month.

# HyperionDev Capstone Projects Instrctions 

For this task, assume that you have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.


	Create a new Python file in this folder called finance_calculators.py.
	
	
	At the top of the file include the line import math

	
	Write the code that will do the following:
	
		1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they
		want to do. How the user capitalises their selection should not
		affect how the program proceeds. I.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or
		‘investment’, ‘Investment’, ‘INVESTMENT’, etc. should all be
		recognised as valid entries. If the user doesn’t type in a valid
		input, show an appropriate error message.
		
		2. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following: 
			
			■ Ask the user to input: 
				
				● The amount of money that they are depositing. 
				
				● The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of
				the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry about
				having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user should
				enter 8 and not 8%. 
				
				● The number of years they plan on investing for. 
				
				● Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple” or
				“compound” interest, and store this in a variable called
				interest. Depending on whether they typed “simple” or
				“compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will
				get after the given period at the interest rate. Look
				below in “Interest formulae” for the formulae to be used.
				
			■ Print out the answer! 
			
			■ Try enter 20 years and 8 (%) and see what the difference is
			depending on the type of interest rate! 
			
		3. If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following: 
			■ Ask the user to input:
			 
				● The present value of the house. E.g. 100000 
				● The interest rate. E.g. 7 
				● The number of months they plan to take to repay the
				bond. E.g. 120
				
			■ Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each
			month and output the answer.
		
		 
# Finance Calculator 
 
Built around the needs of a fictitious company, the finance calculator provides small businesses a user friendly, and lightweight (hardware/software requirements) manner to perform complex 
calculations to determine interest on an investment or interest to be paid on a home loan.    

## Features
The features of the finance_calculators.py is as follows:
* The user should be able to perform two different financial calculations either using *an investment calculator* or *a home loan repayment calculator*.
